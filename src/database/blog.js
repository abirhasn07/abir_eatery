        , details: `Annemarie Rossi, a self-described “regular mom," started a blog to offer simple, healthy, and affordable alternatives to processed foods. Real Food Real Deals follows a four-point checklist for each recipe—real (avoids overly processed ingredients), easy (30 minutes or less), affordable (recipes include the cost breakdown), and flavor (because if it doesn’t taste good, who’s going to eat it?).
Real Food Real Deals takes traditional favorites and adds a nutritious twist, like avocado deviled eggs or carrot and zucchini fritters. Rossi is also the author of the 2014 cookbook, "Conquering Your Kitchen: How to Plan Meals, Shop, and Cook Real Food with Confidence and Purpose!"

        Love, like a chicken salad or restaurant hash, must be taken with blind faith

        , details: `We’re all about chicken for dinner here at Delish. Chicken breasts, thighs (our favorite cut), or even a whole bird all have a spot on our kitchen table. Unfortunately, that can mean falling into a dinner rut much too easily for our liking. If you’re like us, and just can’t bear to make you (or your family’s) old standbys for the umpteenth time, we’ve got you. Get inspired with our list of 65 chicken dinner recipes — you’ll be sure to find a new weeknight favorite.

        We bet you’ve got a classic like chicken Parmesan in your rotation already, so let’s switch it up. We’ve included some fun spins on it here, like chicken parm pasta (with everything bagel seasoning) and mozzarella-stuffed chicken parm. We’ve even got chicken parm meatballs stuffed in a sub sandwich — great for eating outdoors or when you’ve got to do dinner on the go. And Parmesan isn’t just for tomato sauce! We love it just as much in a garlicky, lemon cream sauce, like in our lemon asparagus chicken pasta or paired with breadcrumbs, like in our Parmesan chicken cutlets. And don’t even get us started on alfredo sauce. We’ve included our favorite recipe for chicken alfredo, and a few new ones too. Our fave? Chicken tikka alfredo. Somehow the parmesan + curry works!
        
        While pork and beef sometimes get all the love when it comes to south-of-the-border food, we love using leaner white meat for healthy Mexican-inspired weeknight meals. Chicken pairs SO well with cheese, avocado, and spices, in everything from flautas (pretty much taquitos + chimichangas, if you’re unfamiliar) to quesadillas. Grab a pack of tortillas (or make your own!), and you’ll have myriad different options for how to serve your chicken.
